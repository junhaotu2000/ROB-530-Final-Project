# Front-End and Back-End Optimization of ORB-SLAM3 and VINS-Fusion
This repo is for ROB 530 Final Project

Abstract:      In this project, two typical SLAM algorithm, ORB-SLAM3 and VINS-Fusion are implemented and optimized basing on their structure. Optimization mainly including modifications and additions related to front-end and back-end structure of each method. At the end, the results of various optimization algorithm is compared with its original implementation, following its optimization performance analyzation basing on EuRoC dataset experiments.
